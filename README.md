# -Hacktistic-Task-manager
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. Starting code copied from tutorial by Traversy Media: "React JS Crash Course 2021 " Available: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8 

I added a subtask function so that each task can have its own subtasks (although it is not yet persistent). And also I added a scheduler view so users can look at the tasks on a calendar/scheduler.
